And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
And made Verona's ancient citizens
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
For this time all the rest depart away.
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets
If ever you disturb our streets again,
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word
Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
To know our farther pleasure in this case,
To old Freetown, our common judgment place.
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
With purple fountains issuing from your veins!
You, Capulet, shall go along with me;
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
